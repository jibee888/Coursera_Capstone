    "In this project, we will be digging deeper into the accident data provided to us from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT). The question we aim to answer is this: ***If an accident should occur given the relevant attributes provided, how severe would this accident be?*** \n",

    "We are confident that our findings would be of good use to the SDOT and its associated government agencies (including, but not limited to the Seattle Police Department). For one thing, it would result in more efficient allocation of their resources to prevent injuries and damage to property caused by accidents in the area.\n",

    "For this particular case, the Dependent Variable to predict will be the severity of the accident, or **SEVERITYCODE**. Note that the Severity Codes in the provided CSV file are only limited to two values: 1 and 2. According to the supplementary Metadata file, **SEVERITYCODE 1** corresponds to **Property Damage** and **2** corresponds to **Injury**. Thus, the model we will create will be geared towards ***predicting the likelihood of a potential accident to lead to Property Damage or Injury.***\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** There were other Severity Codes disclosed on the Metadata: 0 (Unknown), 2b (Serious Injury), and 3 (Fatality). We believe these were omitted because the dataset already had thousands of rows to work on without these Severity Codes. 0 (Unknown) was most likely omitted because of its potential to confuse the model. Finally, we believe 2 (Injury) would be of utmost importance because we don't want to wait for serious injuries or fatalities to happen before we work on data. In other words if we could prevent injury we could definitely prevent worse things from happening. \n"
